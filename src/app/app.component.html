      <div style="font-size: large;">
      i was inspired by my internship in summer 2024 as i learned about web/app dev for the 
      first time, and it made me want to make this to practice (and perhaps show) some skills! hopefully
      this showcases my excitement and effort, even as a non cs major (but in the tech space regardless).
      enjoy your visit, and let me know how it is, even though i know my skills are by no means extraordinary.
