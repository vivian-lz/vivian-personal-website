            why am i here?
        </header>
        <p>i like to think i always wanted to be an engineer. i have always loved mathematics
            since i was little for the simple fact that you can take problems and think really
            hard until you craft a correct solution that is really rewarding, which engineers
            do on an innovative scale. anyone who reads a "why engineering" essay from me would
            know that when i was 11 i watched youtube videos of child prodigy innovators that
            inspired me to pursue engineering, simply because of the fact that i loved how they
            could take trash and truly turn it to treasure, tinkering and playing with electronic
            parts to create a product that can actually help the communities around them. that spark
            of excitement to tinker with electronics will always be my north star as to why i do, 
            well, what i do.
        </p>

        <p>i am an electrical and comupter engineering major at vanderbilt university with minors in
            math and digital fabrication (probably, those minors are not set in stone). i am currently only
            an incoming sophomore as i am making this, but i have done a few engineering projects.
        </p>
        
        <p>if you want to see everything i have done, i recommend checking out my contact page and 
            looking for project details on my linkedin, because i promise literally everything is there
            and i update and check linkedin fairly often!
        </p>

        <p>
            if you actually read all of this, i am impressed. thanks for caring!
